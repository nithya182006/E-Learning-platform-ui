 I developed the front-end of the e-learning platform using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript to create a responsive and interactive user interface. I began by designing the course listing page, where each course is dynamically rendered using JavaScript with basic details like the title and description. When a user selects a course, they are directed to a detailed course page that features an embedded video player for seamless content playback. To enhance user engagement, I implemented a simulated progress tracking system using a progress bar that updates over time. The layout was styled using CSS to ensure a clean and modern look, with attention to user experience and accessibility. Overall, the front-end was structured to provide a clear and intuitive navigation flow, laying the foundation for a scalable learning platform.
